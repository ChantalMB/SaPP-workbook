# Report on SaPP Fall 2020
## HIST4916A Museums & Digital History

The Fall semester of 2020 was a tumultuous time of learning for all of those involved in education, for students and faculty alike. With university becoming an entirely online environment for the first time, there was no established pedagogical methodology to follow so each course became an experiment, and the responses of both those teaching and learning became the results that had to actively be taken note of as the semester unfolded. When I initially began my SaPP position with Dr Shawn Graham, I anticipated a much more technologically-centred role with a focus on gathering data and creating tutorials that could teach my peers how to work with it; and while I did do this, as students’ responses to the online semester were continuously discussed, a significant amount of my time working ended up being dedicated to forming the structure of [HIST4916A: Museums & Digital History](https://dhmuse.netlify.app/) to incorporate the feedback we had been receiving.

During the Fall semester, Dr Graham made an active effort to understand the situation of his students as they pursued their education digitally through consistent communication and interaction in his course’s Discord server, which I was also apart of. A number of students stated that they struggled with courses which simply transferred the usual, more rigid format they took to the online environment rather than altering the course to work with and better suit a fully digitized workload, resulting in many weekly assignments and lengthy lectures delivered over video communication platforms with unpredictable performance for many.

Taking these comments from students into consideration, Dr Graham and I often deliberated over what we could add or remove from the course to accommodate students’ needs, until November when it was decided that the course would entirely be restructured in a way we hope will keep students engaged and learning, yet not overwhelm them with rigid expectations or work. The [second week of the course](https://dhmuse.netlify.app/week/two/instructions/) is dedicated to allowing students to explore media related to how cultural heritage informatics intersects with GLAM sectors, then forming how the remainder of the course will be scheduled based on specific topics of interest by asking them to place their findings in a [collaborative Padlet board](https://padlet.com/shawngraham1/jnpyi1hmkjbtzbp0).

In the same vein, part of my technical work became finding sources of data to act as starting points for students to gather from, rather than doing so myself. Using tutorials delivered through both [video walkthroughs](https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/jupyter/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/technotes-toc/), we gradually build up the technicals skills of students in order to give them the flexibility of using any data resource they choose to explore and create with, so they may ultimately contribute a notebook to the final collaborative course project, an Ottawa-based variant of the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.github.io/).

While gathering resources and creating tutorials that gave examples on how to use this data, not only were my technical skills honed as I consolidated what I have learned across the digital humanities and computer science courses I’ve taken at Carleton, I also discovered new aspects of the field that I hope to pursue further as I move into graduate studies in the library and information science sector. As I scoured what Ottawa’s GLAM institutions had made available digitally, although all offered the ability to search collections on their websites, there was rarely open data that those accessing the collections could easily use for analysis to interrogate its contents further. To quote the [syllabus](https://dhmuse.netlify.app/docs/1-coursedescription/), “pursuing the effective use of cultural heritage data, information, and knowledge for humanistic or scientific inquiry, problem-solving, and decision making” can aid in finding and dismantling harmful structures that remain lingering in the data found in our GLAM sectors. Although Ottawa’s GLAM sector presently lacks in terms of accessible open data, I hope that the work I did during my time participating in SaPP and the subsequent work my peers create from these tutorials and resources can act as a starting point for improving cultural heritage informatics in Ottawa, whether through the data generated or what students choose to do with their newfound knowledge after.
