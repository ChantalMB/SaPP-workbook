# Jupyter Notebooks

- "To start working with the data from the ADS, you need to put together your toolkit. You're currently working inside something called a jupyter notebook, which will be a key part of your analysis toolkit. It's a place to keep notes, pictures, code and maps together. You can add tools and data into your jupyter notebook and then use them to ask questions and make maps and visualisations that help answer those questions." -[Opitz](https://github.com/ropitz/spatialarchaeology/blob/master/ADSDataExercise.ipynb)
