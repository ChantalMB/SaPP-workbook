## Outline
- Install miniconda
  - Create a python virtual environment (explain why)
    - It isolates your working environment --> you can install only the packages you need and they will stay local to that environment (prevents version conflicts and lets you choose your version of Python) and bonus is if you really mess up somehow you can always delete the environment and totally start over
  - 
- Installing Jupyter Notebook locally
- Explore OzGLAM
  - Simple intro
  - [GLAM CSV Explorer](https://glam-workbench.github.io/csv-explorer/)

- Load notebook locally: [Explore NMA collection objects over time](https://glam-workbench.github.io/nma/)
- Demo running it
  - How to locate files
  - Where output goes
  - How to modify
- Push to git using command line!
- Make it live on myBinder!

## Notes
- "To start working with the data from the ADS, you need to put together your toolkit. You're currently working inside something called a jupyter notebook, which will be a key part of your analysis toolkit. It's a place to keep notes, pictures, code and maps together. You can add tools and data into your jupyter notebook and then use them to ask questions and make maps and visualisations that help answer those questions." -[Opitz](https://github.com/ropitz/spatialarchaeology/blob/master/ADSDataExercise.ipynb)
