  - Offers collections of artworks and items from Ottawa historical museums --> cannot find exportable data, would have to be scraped


## Museums
- Canadian Museum of Nature
  - Cannot export data --> contact for assistance
  - Many collections use scientific terminology which may confuse history students
  - Items typically list a specific location --> could be used for mapping
  - DIY Collection of Ottawa's natural history?

- Canadian Museum of History
  - [Found this linked site which has a lot of digitized text documents](https://www.canadiana.ca/)

- Ingenium Museum Network
  - [FINALLY SOME OPEN DATA](https://ingeniumcanada.org/collection-research/artifact-open-data-set-mash-up)
    - All artifacts in the collection of the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum, Canada Aviation and Space Museum and the Canada Science and Technology Museum
    - Available in XML or CSV
    - CSV has some formatting quirks --> can't check XML because it exceeds the maximum for google sheets 


## Misc
- Could potentially use the cemetery dataset created in HIST3000
- All LAC databases would have to be scraped
